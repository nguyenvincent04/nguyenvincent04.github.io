### CPSC 120

* Lab 7
 
Lab 7, part 1 was my favorite because even though there was a lot to do for this part, there were a lot of good parts which I liked. I got to try out new things that I had never seen before.  I was able to write the date difference code and I was able to keep organized with the codes and although it is long, it was fun coding this program.

* Lab 9

Lab 9, part 2 was my favorite because I got to figure out how to use the coding to make spelling and with a dictionary. I was able to get down the parts where it prints out the actual with the right spelling. It was mostly getting creative of what to put on and it would spell out.


* Lab 11

Lab 11, part 1 was my favorite because I was really interested in seeing how this type of coding can create many different classes of states. I love the part where I have to put in the amount of population, making the name, and choosing where it can be. I figured out what part to put for the codes and this can help me in the future.
